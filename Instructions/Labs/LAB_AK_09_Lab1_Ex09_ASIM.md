# Module 9 - Lab 1 - Exercise 9 - Deploy ASIM parsers

## Lab scenario


You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You need to model ASIM parsers for a specific User Management event. These parsers will be finalized at a later time following the [Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM) User Management Event normalization schema reference].

>**Important:** The lab exercises for Learning Path #9 are in a *standalone* environment. If you exit the lab before completing it, you will be required to re-run the configurations again.
