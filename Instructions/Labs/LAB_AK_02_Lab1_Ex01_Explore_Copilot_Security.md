### Task 3: Explore the Microsoft Security Copilot embedded experience

In this exercise, you investigate an incident in Microsoft Defender XDR. As part of the investigation, you explore the key features of Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft Defender XDR, including incident summary, device summary, script analysis, and more. You also pivot your investigation to the standalone experience and use the pin board as a way to share details of your investigation with your colleagues.

You're logged in as Avery Howard and have the Copilot owner role. You'll work in Microsoft Defender, using the new unified security operations platform, to access the embedded Copilot capabilities in Microsoft Defender XDR. Towards the end of the exercise, you pivot to the standalone experience of Microsoft Security Copilot.

This exercise should take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

1. Open the simulated environment by selecting this link: **[Microsoft Defender portal](https://app.highlights.guide/start/f4f590f6-8937-40f9-91ec-632de546ab98?token=40f793d4-2956-40a4-b11a-6b3d4f92557f&azure-portal=true)**.

1. From the Microsoft Defender portal:

   - Expand **Investigation & response**.
   - Expand  **Incidents & alerts**.
   - Select **Incidents**.

     ![](../Media/lab2-40.png)

1. Select the first incident in the list, **Incident Id: 30342** named Human-operated ransomware attack was launched from a compromised asset (attack disruption).

   ![](../Media/lab2-41.png)

1. This is a complex incident. Defender XDR provides a great deal of information, but with 72 alerts it can be a challenge to know where to focus. On the right side of the incident page, Copilot automatically generates an **Incident summary** that helps guide your focus and response. Select **See more**.

   ![](../Media/lab2-42.png)

1. Copilot's summary describes how this incident has evolved, including initial access, lateral movement, collection, credential access and exfiltration. It identifies specific devices, indicates that the PsExec tool was used to launch executable files, and more.

1. These are all items you can leverage for further investigation. You explore some of these in subsequent tasks.

1. Scroll down on the Copilot panel and just beneath the summary are **Guided responses**. Guided responses recommend actions in support of triage, containment, investigation, and remediation.

1. The first item in the triage category it to Classify this incident. Select **Classify** to view the options. Review the guided responses in the other categories.

1. Select the **Status** button at the top of the guided responses section and filter on **Completed**. Two completed activities show labeled as Attack Disruption. Automatic attack disruption is designed to contain attacks in progress, limit the impact on an organization's assets, and provide more time for security teams to remediate the attack fully.

   ![](../Media/lab2-43.png)

1. Keep the incident page open, you'll use it in the next task.

1. From the incident page, select the first alert **Suspicious URL clicked**.

1. Copilot  automatically generates an **Alert summary**, which provides a wealth of information for further analysis. For example, the summary identifies suspicious activity, it identifies data collection activities, credential access, malware, discovery activities, and more.

   ![](../Media/lab2-44.png)

1. There's a lot of information on the page, so to get a better view of this alert, select **Open alert page**. It's on the third panel on the alert page, next to the incident graph and below the alert title.

   ![](../Media/lab2-45.png)

1. On the top of the page, is card for the device parkcity-win10v. Select the ellipses and note the options. Select **Summarize**. Copilot generates a **Device summary**. It's worth nothing that there are many ways you can access device summary and this is just one convenient method. The summary shows the device is a VM, identifies the owner of the device, it shows its compliance status against Intune policies, and more.

1. Next to the device card is a card for the owner of the device. Select **parkcity\jonaw**. The third panel on the page updates from showing details of the alert to providing information about the user Jonathan Wolcott, an account executive, whose Microsoft Entra ID risk and Insider risk severity are classified as high. These aren't surprising given what you've learned from the Copilot incident and alert summaries. Select the ellipses then select  **Summarize** to obtain an identity summary generated by Copilot.

1. Keep the alert page open, you'll use it in the next task.

1. Let's Focus on the alert story. Select **Maximize**, located on the main panel of the alert, just beneath the card labeled 'partycity\jonaw' to get a better view of the process tree. From maximized view, you begin to get a clearer view of how this incident came to be. Many line items indicate that powershell.exe executed a script. Since the user Jonathan Wolcott is an account executive, it's reasonable to assume that executing PowerShell scripts isn't something this user is likely to be doing regularly.

1. Expand the first instance of **powershell.exe execute a script**, it's the one showing the timestamp of 2:27:11 PM. Copilot has the capability to analyze scripts. Select **Analyze**.

   ![](../Media/lab2-46.png)

1. Copilot generates an analysis of the script and suggests it could be a phishing attempt or used to deliver a web-based exploit.

1. Select **Show code**. The code shows a defanged URL.

1. There are several other items that indicate powershell.exe executed a script. Expand the one labeled **powershell.exe -EncodedCommand...** . The original script was base 64 encoded, but Defender has decoded that for you. For the decoded version, select **Analyze**. The analysis highlights the sophistication of the script used in this attack.

   ![](../Media/1111.png)

1. Close the alert story page by selecting the **X** (the X that is to the left of Copilot panel). Now use the breadcrumb to return to the incident. Select **Human-operated ransomware attack was launched from a compromised asset (attack disruption)**.

1. You're back at the incident page. In the alert summary, Copilot identified the file Rubeus.exe, which is associated with the 'Kekeo' malware. You can use the file analysis capability in Defender XDR to see what other insights you can get. There are several ways to access files. From the top of the page, select the **Evidence and Response** tab.

1. From the left side of the screen select **Files**.

1. Select the first item from the list with the entity named **Rubeus.exe**.

1. From the window that opens, select **Analyze(1)**. Copilot generates a summary.

   ![](../Media/lab2-47.png)

1. Review the detailed file analysis that Copilot generates.

1. Close the file analysis window.

1. Return to the incident page by selecting the **Attack story** tab from the top of the page.

1. Select the ellipses next to Copilot's Incident summary and select **Open in Copilot for Security**.

1. Copilot opens in the standalone experience and shows the incident summary. You can also run more prompts. In this case, you'll run the promptbook for an incident. Select the **prompt icon**. 

1. Select **See all promptbooks**.

1. Select **Microsoft 365 Defender incident investigation**.

1. The promptbook page opens and asks for the Defender Incident ID. Enter **30342 (1)** then select **Run (2)**.

   ![](../Media/lab2-48.png)

1. Review the information provided. By pivoting to the standalone experience and running the promptbook, the investigation is able to invoke capabilities from a broader set security solution, beyond just Defender XDR, based on the plugins enabled.

1. Select the **box icon (1)** next to the pin icon to select all the prompts and and the corresponding responses, then select the **Pin icon (2)** to save those responses to the pin board.

1. The pin board opens automatically. The pin board holds your saved prompts and responses, along with a summary of each one. You can open and close the pin board by selecting the **pin board icon**.

1. From the top of the page, select **Share (3)** to view your options. By sharing the incident via a link or email, people in your organization with Copilot access can view this session. Close the window by selecting the **X**.

   ![](../Media/lab2-49.png)

1. You can now close the browser tab to exit the simulation.
