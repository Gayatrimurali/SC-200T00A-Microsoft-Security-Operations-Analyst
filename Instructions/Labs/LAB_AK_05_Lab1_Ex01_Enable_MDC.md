## Lab objectives
 In this lab, you will perform the following:
- Task 1: Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Task 2: Understanding the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Dashboard
- Task 3: Install Azure Arc on an On-Premises Server

### Estimated timing: 15 minutes

1. Close the Defender plans page by selecting the 'X' on the upper right of the page to go back to the **Environment settings**. --->

### Task 2: Understanding the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Dashboard

In this task, you will explore the Microsoft Defender for Cloud dashboard to familiarize yourself with its interface, features, and how it provides insights into your cloud environment's security posture.

1. In the Search bar of the Microsoft Azure portal, type **Defender for Cloud (1)**, then select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud (2)**.

   ![Picture 1](../Media/lab5-8.png)

1. In the left navigation menu for Microsoft Defender for Cloud, under the *General* section, select **Overview**.

   ![Picture 1](../Media/lab5-12.png)

1. The Overview blade provides a unified view into the security posture and includes multiple independent cloud security pillars such as Security posture, Regulatory compliance, Workload protections, Firewall Manager, Inventory, and Information Protection (preview). Each of these pillars also has its dedicated dashboard allowing deeper insights and actions around that vertical, providing easy access and better visibility for security professionals.

    >**Note:** The top menu bar includes a **Subscriptions** button, allowing you to view and filter subscriptions. In this lab, we will use only one subscription, but selecting different or additional subscriptions will update the interface to reflect the security posture of the chosen subscriptions.

1. Click on the **What’s new** icon link – a new tab opens with the latest release notes where you can stay current on the new features, bug fixes, and more.

    ![Picture 1](../Media/lab5-13.png)

    >**Note:** The high-level numbers in the top menu provide a summary of your subscriptions, active recommendations, security alerts, and connected cloud accounts.

1. From the top menu bar, select **Azure subscriptions**. This will bring you into the environment settings where you can select from the available subscriptions.

   ![Picture 1](../Media/lab5-14.png)

1. Return to the **Overview** page, and review the **Security posture** tile. You can see your current *Secure score* along with the number of completed controls and recommendations. Selecting this tile will redirect you to a drill-down view across subscriptions.

1. On the **Regulatory compliance** tile, you can get insights into your compliance posture based on continuous assessment of both Azure and hybrid cloud environments. This tile shows the following standards which are Microsoft Cloud Security benchmark, and Lowest compliance regulatory standard. To view the data we first need to add Security policies.

   ![Picture 1](../Media/lab5-16.png)

1. Selecting this tile will redirect you to the **Regulatory compliance** dashboard – where you can add additional standards and explore the current ones.

1. We will continue exploring *Microsoft Defender for Cloud* **Security posture** and **Regulatory compliance** in the next exercise.

### Task 3: Install Azure Arc on an On-Premises Server

In this task, you install Azure Arc on an on-premises server to make onboarding easier.

>**Important:** The next steps will be performed on a different machine than the one you were previously using. Be sure to check the Virtual Machine name references. 

>**Important:** The *Windows Security Events via AMA* data connector requires Azure Arc for non-Azure devices. 

1. In the lab virtual machine, search for **Hyper-V Manager** from task bar and select to open.
