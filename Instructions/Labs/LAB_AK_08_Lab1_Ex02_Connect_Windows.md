# Module 8 - Lab 1 - Exercise 2 - Connect Windows devices to Microsoft Sentinel using data connectors

## Lab scenario

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You must learn how to connect log data from the many data sources in your organization. The next source of data is Windows virtual machines inside and outside of Azure, like On-Premises environments or other Public Clouds.

>**Important:** The lab exercises for Learning Path #8 are in a *standalone* environment. If you exit the lab before completing it, you will be required to re-run the configurations again.

## Lab objectives
 In this lab, you will perform the following:
- Task 1: Create a Windows Virtual Machine in Azure
- Task 2: Install Azure Arc on an On-Premises Server
- Task 3: Connect an Azure Windows virtual machine
- Task 4: Connect a non-Azure Windows Machine

### Estimated Duration: 30 minutes
